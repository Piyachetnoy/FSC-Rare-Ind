# Few-Shot Counting for Custom Industrial Objects

Automation of industrial objects counting, using **Few-Shot Counting** and **Feature Detection** approach.

## Description

Counting industrial objects is challenging due to their similar appearances and complex shapes. This paper
adapts Few-Shot Counting (FSC) to minimize labeled data requirements while improving accuracy. We use Fam-
Net with rule-based feature detection to enhance robustness in industrial settings. Additionally, we introduce the
INDT dataset, focusing on diverse industrial objects. Our approach integrates density map estimation with feature
detection to improve interpretability and reduce over-counting errors. Experimental results show improved accu-
racy on industrial objects and strong generalization to other datasets, highlighting FSCâ€™s potential for industrial
automation, with future work aimed at optimizing model structure and feature extraction for further performance
improvements.
